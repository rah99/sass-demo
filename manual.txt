*****Instruction/explaination*****
1.  Sass = Syntactically Awesome StyleSheets
2.  CSS PreProcessor/Extension
3.  Makes for CSS to be compiled in an actual programming language StyleSheets
4.  Sass is not read by the browser/HTML therefore needs a compiler, such as, Node module (command line) and VSC Extension (renders in VSC)
5.  File extension can be .scss - backwards compatible with regular CSS or .sass where indentation is used over braces
6.  Variables are prefixed with "$" - CSS can make use of variables, called, custom properties
7.  Advamtages of Sass:
                    a.  Nesting
                    b.  Modularisation, as in, create a base.scss (name must have an underscore e.g. "_base.scss" so as it does not compile) file 
                        and import it into the styles.css ("@use 'base';")
                    c.  Can use functions and mixins (injecting code into a class) used through "@include <name>"
                    d.  Inheritance created using "%" as a prefix and using "@extend <name>" to include in a style
                    e.  Operators, as in, create calculations for container sizing or float values for example
                    f.  Conditionals, as in, use logic such as if/else statements
8.  Sass compliers:
                    a.  Using Node: npm i -g sass
                                i.  Once installed use: sass --watch scss/style.scss css/style.css (this is the location of your scss file and css file)
                    b.  Using Live Sass Compiler - VS Code - install the extension "Live Sass Compiler"
                                i.      This will create a "Watch Sass" entry in the bottom Task bar
                                ii.     Changes the workbench (your own, not the main default settings) settings.JSON
                                        (search for "Live Sass Complier" in "Command Palette")
                                                "liveSassCompile.settings.formats": [
                                                    {
                                                        "format": "compressed", // Can be "extended" and then minify it using https://www.cleancss.com/
                                                        "extensionName": ".css", // This can also be .min.css
                                                        "savePath": "/css" // The path must be to where you want your CSS file to be complied, e.g.
                                                        if you have a dist folder for deployment then the path would be "/dist/css or /dist"
                                                    }
                                                ],
                                                "liveSassCompile.settings.generateMap": false, // So as it does not generate a map
                                                "editor.wordWrap": "on", // So as you can see the .css file that is created - else it is on one long line
                                iii.    Selecting "Watch Sass" will compile the .css file in the selected folder as above (minified due to "compressed" 
                                        selected above)
                                iv.     The compiler will notify of errors
9.  If sass created using @import (this marked for deprecation), conversion can be performed by:
                    a.  npm i -g sass-migrator (Node) or
                        choco install sass-migrator (Chocolatey)
                        brew install sass/sass/migrator (Homebrew)
